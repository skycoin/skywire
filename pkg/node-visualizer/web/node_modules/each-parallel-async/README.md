$ npm install --save each-parallel-async
```

## Usage

```js
var each = require('each-parallel-async');
var result = [];

each([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], function(ele, next) {
  result.push(ele * (i + 1));
  next();
}, function (err) {
  console.log(result);
  //=> [ 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36 ]
});
```

**Params**

* `array` **{Array}** - (required) Array of elements to loop over
* `next` **{Function}** - (required) Function to call on each element in the array
* `callback` **{Function}** - (required) Final callback function, called after `next` is called on each element in the array.
