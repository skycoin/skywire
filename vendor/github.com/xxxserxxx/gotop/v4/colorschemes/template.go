/*
Colorscheme defines colors and fonts used by TUI elements. The standard
256 terminal colors are supported.

For int values, -1 = clear

Colors may be combined with 'Bold', 'Underline', or 'Reverse' by using
bitwise OR ('|') and the name of the Color. For example, to get bold red
labels, you would use 'Labels: 2 | Bold'
