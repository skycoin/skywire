# progkit

A small widget kit for terminal programs on [tcell v3](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell)
that are progressive terminal programs, as
[websh's PROTOCOL.md](https://github.com/0magnet/websh/blob/main/PROTOCOL.md)
describes them.

Every widget draws itself in cells, so a program built on it runs in any
terminal. Where the host offers placements and shipped widgets, as websh does,
an input, a button, a list or a text view is also laid over its cells as the
page's own element. The person types into a real text field, clicks a real
button and selects and copies real text, and what they do reaches the program
as it would from the keyboard. Keys typed in an element reach the program too:
Esc and Tab from a text field, and every plain key from the others.

```go
app, err := progkit.Open() // the terminal, asked first what its host offers
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}
defer app.Close()

in := &progkit.Input{ID: "q", Placeholder: "search"}
app.Run(func(f *progkit.Frame) {
	in.Draw(f, progkit.Rect{X: 0, Y: 0, W: f.W, H: 1}, true)
}, func(ev tcell.Event) bool {
	if k, ok := ev.(*tcell.EventKey); ok {
		if k.Key() == tcell.KeyEscape {
			return false
		}
		in.Key(k)
	}
	return true
})
```

The widgets are `Input`, `Button`, `List`, `Text` (a scrolling view that takes
ANSI colored output) and `Spinner`, with `Box` and `DrawLine` for the rest. Each
placed element is the one shipped document, `widget.html`, told by a post what
to be. Only changed placements and changed elements are sent after a frame.

`cmd/progkitdemo` uses all of them. Run it natively, or build it for js/wasm
and run it from websh's filesystem:

```sh
GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o progkitdemo.wasm ./cmd/progkitdemo
```

`make check` runs the linters and the tests.
