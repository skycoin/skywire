# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to this theme! Many hands make light work, and you're more than welcome.

Here are a couple ways you can help out.

## Open an Issue

Please open an issue to ask questions, report bugs, troubleshoot the project, or discuss anything that might need fixing or updating. You can follow one of the [templates](https://github.com/victoriadrake/hugo-theme-sam/issues/new/choose) to make sure you provide helpful information.

## Send a Pull Request

If you would like to change or fix something yourself, a pull request (PR) is most welcome! Please open an issue before you start working. That way, you can let other people know that you're taking care of it and no one ends up doing extra work.

Please [fork the repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo), then check out a local branch that includes the issue number, such as `fix-<issue number>`. For example, `git checkout -b fix-42`.

Before you submit your PR, make sure your fork is [synced with `master`](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork), then [create a PR](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). You may want to [allow edits from maintainers](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) for help with small changes like fixing typos.
