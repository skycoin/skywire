## Introduction
This article represents the central source of information for the Skywire mainnet. All information about rewards and potential changes will be published here, so check in regularely.

* Read this information thoroughly and ask in the [Skywire](https://t.me/skywire) Telegram channel if some things appear to not be covered. 
* Please join [SkywirePSA](https://t.me/SkywirePSA) as well to get structured public service announcements (PSA) about the Skywire project.
* In case you bought an official Skyminer in the [Skycoin hardware store](https://store.skycoin.com/) please read [the Official Skyminer Guide](https://github.com/skycoin/skywire/wiki/Skyminer-Official-Guide) if you haven't done that already. 
* Participants will be contacted at the beginning of every month via the so-called *Skywire Status Update Emails* including details of their last month's Skywire mainnet participation.
* You can contact support at store.skycoin.com/pages/support or via email at `support [at] skycoin.com`

***

## Rules
This section covers the rules of the mainnet. Dependent on the amount of miners that are associated with your emails, some of these rules may apply to you or not.

Currently, each person participating in the Skywire mainnet may own one DIY miner and/or multiple official Skyminers to be eligible for rewards.
<div align="center"><b>A DIY miner cannot be in the same location as another DIY or official Skyminer.</b></div><br>

Based on this central rule, each whitelisted person is eligible to receive rewards for:
* one or multiple official Skyminers 

*and/or*

* one DIY miner with up to 8 (eight) visors, (provided it is at a different location if you also have an official Skyminer).

<div align="center"><b>You must use the <a href="https://whitelist.skycoin.com">Skywire Whitelisting System</a> to keep your submitted data up-to-date</b>
<br><em> Read<a href="https://github.com/skycoin/skywire/wiki/Skywire-Whitelisting-System"> the Skywire whitelisting system user guide</a> to familiarize yourself with the new system.</em></div>
<br>
Different locations are required due to the fact that we want to spread out the meshnet and not create built-up areas. This prevents paying people to simply run single board computers (SBC) and to require them to provide a service to the network.

* If you are running two separate miners in the same location because you're joining the network with someone living in the same house you still have to move one of your miners to another location. 

<div align="center"><em>Submitting miners under multiple email addresses is forbidden and very likely to be detected - measures will be taken if such actions are recognized.</em></div>

***

## Rewards
**Skywire Visors must be running Skywire v0.4.2 or higher to receive rewards.** Note that the required minimal Skywire version is subject to change and will be updated from time-to-time. We'll keep the minimal version requirement at least one release behind the most recent one to provide everyone with sufficient time to upgrade.
<br>
* The rewards are **paid every subsequent month around the 5th** (short delays are possible)
* Adjustments of previous months are included in these reward distributions on the 5th.
* The deadline to submit complaints is being published in the monthly Skywire status update emails and in the [Skywire PSA channel on Telegram](https://t.me/SkywirePSA).
* Eligible for rewards are only the whitelisted visors that **comply with the Skywire mainnet rules** and **meet the uptime requirement** of the respective month (usually 75%).
* Updates of user data in the Skywire Whitelisting System are only guaranteed to be recognized for reward distributions if they are submitted during the respective calendar month for which the rewards are being calculated.

### Official Skyminers 

There are two different reward methods for official miners:
* official Skyminers Skycoin Pool Method:
  - first & second batch official Skyminer
  - third batch official Skyminers that have received all of the 24 fixed Skycoin payments
* official Skyminers SKY/USD Method:
  - **sold through** the [hardware store](https://store.skycoin.com)

<em>Faulty Orange Pi Primes/routers of official Skyminers will be rewarded regardless of your uptime until you receive a replacement. If the replacement doesn't arrive in time for you to make the uptime requirement because it arrived on short notice or not on the schedule at all you will be rewarded as well. Since we are taking care of this manually you are requested to contact one of our team members on Telegram (@Paperstream @asxtree) or at store.skycoin.com/pages/support</em>

<h4>Official Skyminers - Pool Method</h4>

Rewards are being paid on a visor by visor basis. The total amount of rewards is limited by a pool size that is subject to change:
* You can receive a maximum of 12.0 Skycoin per visor
    - official Skyminers consist of eight visors and one visor that may be additionally serving as hypervisor
* Rewards are being calculated on a visor by visor basis
    - you'll receive up to 8 Skycoin per-visor rewards
* The total pool size is being divided evenly between all visors eligible for receiving rewards. This implies that you will receive less than 12.0 Skycoin per-visor rewards in case the pool size would be surpassed.

### Official Skyminers - New Batches

<h4>Official Skyminers - SKY/USD Method</h4>

<div align="center">
<em><u>Fixed Skycoin payments can be claimed within three years after purchase.</u></em><br/><br/>
You will receive a fixed Skycoin payments per month <b>in addition</b> to any traffic forwarding payments <br/> that you will receive in the Skywire mainnet.<br/><strong>
Fixed Skycoin payments per month = USD Miner Price / 24 = $83.30 USD.</strong>
<br>
</div>
<br/>
<div align="center"><i>Your fixed Skycoin payments are dependent on the uptime of your visors. All of your 8 visors must meet the uptime requirement for you to receive the full $83.30 USD, it is therefore <strong>super important to keep your visors online.</strong></i></div>
<br>
<em>Faulty Orange Pi Primes/Orange Pi 3s or Skyminer Routers of official Skyminers will be rewarded regardless of your uptime until you receive a replacement. If the replacement doesn't arrive in time for you to make the uptime requirement because it arrived on short notice or not on the schedule at all you will be rewarded as well. Since we are taking care of this manually you are requested to contact one of our team members on Telegram (@Paperstream @asxtree) or at store.skycoin.com/pages/support</em>

Summary:
* You are eligible to receive 24 fixed Skycoin payments ($83.30 USD)
* The 24 fixed Skycoin payments are comprised of 8 Skycoin visor payments ($10.4125 USD)
    - official Skyminers consist of eight visors and one visor that may be additionally serving as hypervisor
    - you'll receive up to 8 Skycoin visor payments per month based on the individual uptime of your visors 
* The uptime of all visors in your official Skyminer is being evaluated on a visor-by-visor basis
* After these 24 payments, the reward model automatically changes to the [pool method reward model](https://github.com/skycoin/skywire/blob/master/mainnet_rules.md#official-skyminers)
* *You will receive traffic forwarding payments once the Skywire mainnet with bandwidth metering is live*

#### Skycoin Price Calculation
We are calculating the underlying Skycoin price for your rewards based on the moving average exponential method:
- timespan 1M on the Tradingview SKY/USD chart
- 30 day length
- starting on the 1st day of the subsequent month at 00:00

- Up to eight (8) DIY visors are being rewarded per user account in the Skywire Whitelisting System.
- The total amount of DIY rewards is limited by a pool size that is subject to change.
