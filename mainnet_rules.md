# Uptime Reward Pool

408000 Skycoin are distributed annually to those visors which meet the mimimum uptime and the other requirements listed below.

The reward amount for a day is evenly divided among those eligible participants on the basis of having met uptime and other requirements, for the previous day.

A total of up to ~1117.808 Skycoin are distributed daily in non leap-years.

A total of up to ~1114.754  Skycoin are distributed daily in leap-years.

## Rules & Requirements

To receive Skycoin rewards for running skywire, the following requirements must be met:


* 1) **Minimum skywire version v1.3.26** - Cutoff October 1st 2024

* 2) **75% [uptime](#uptime) per day** minimum is required to be eligible to receive rewards

* 3) The visor must be an **ARM or RISC architecture SBC** ~running on approved [hardware](#hardware)~

* 4) Visors must be running on **[the skywire production deployment](#deployment)** with a config that is updated on every version. No default keys or addresses of this configuration may be removed - but you can add keys where applicable.

* 5) **Only 1 (one) visor per machine**

* 6) **Up to 8 (eight) visors may each receive 1 (one) reward share per location (ip address)**

* 7) **A valid [skycoin address](#skycoin-address)** must be set for the visor

* 8) The visor must be **[connected to the DMSG network](#connection-to-dmsg-network)**

* 9) **[Transports](#transportability) can be established to the visor**

* 10) **The visor responds to [Transport Setup-Node requests](#transport-setup-node)**

* 11) **The visor responds to [pings](#ping-latency-metric)** - needed for latency-based rewards

* 12) **The visor produces [transport bandwidth logs](#transport-bandwidth-logs)** - needed for bandwidth-based rewards

* 13) **The visor produces a [survey](#survey)** when queried over dmsg by any keys in the survey_whitelist array by default


### Exceptions for Deployment Changes with dmsghttp-config (Chinese users)

All the production deployment services may be accessed by the visor over the dmsg network when the visor runs with a dmsghttp config.

This type of config is generated automatically based on region (via `skywire cli config gen -b --bestproto`), to circumvent ISP blocking of http requests.

In order to bootstrap the visor's to connection to the dmsg network (via TCP connection to an individual dmsg server) the `dmsghttp-config.json` is provided with the skywire binary release.

In the instance that the skywire production deployment changes - specifically the dmsg servers - it will be necessary to update to the next version or package release which fixes the dmsg servers - or else to manually update the `dmsghttp-config.json` which is provided by your skywire installation.

Currently, **there is no mechanism for updating the dmsghttp-config.json which does not require an http request** ; a request which may be blocked depending on region.

In this instance, the visor will not connect to any service because it is not connected to the dmsg network, so it will not be possible for the visor to accumulate uptime or for the reward system to collect the survey, which are prerequisite for reward eligibility.

As a consequence of this; any visors running a dmsghttp-config, and hence any visors running in regions such as China, the minimum version requirement for obtaining rewards is not only the latest available version, but __the latest release of the package__ unless the dmsghttp-config.json is updated manually.

## Verifying Requirements & Eligibility

### Version

View the version of skywire you are running with:
```
skywire cli -v
skywire visor -v
```

The update deadlines specify the version of software required as of (i.e. on or before) the specified date in order to maintain reward eligibility:


**Reward eligibility after 9-1-2024 requires Skywire v1.3.25**

Requirement established 8-21-2024

Rewards Cutoff date for updating 9-1-2024

**Reward eligibility after 10-1-2024 requires Skywire v1.3.26**

Requirement established 9-24-2024

Rewards Cutoff date for updating 10-1-2024

### Deployment

The deployment your visor is running on can be verified by comparing the services configured in the visor's `.json` config against [conf.skywire.skycoin.com](https://conf.skywire.skycoin.com)

```
cat /opt/skywire/skywire.json
```

The service configuration will be automatically updated any time a config is generated or regenerated.

For those visors in china or those running a dmsghttp-config, compare the dmsghttp-config of your current installation with the dmsghttp-config on the develop branch of [github.com/skycoin/skywire](https://github.com/skycoin/skywire)


### Uptime

Daily uptime statistics for all visors may be accessed via the
- [uptime tracker](https://ut.skywire.skycoin.com/uptimes?v=v2)
or using skywire cli
- `skywire cli ut -n0 -k <public-key>`

### Skycoin Address

The skycoin address to be rewarded can be set from the cli:

```
skywire cli reward <skycoin-address>
```

or via the hypervisor UI.

the example above shows the genesis address for the skycoin blockchain. **Please do not use the genesis address.**

It is __highly recommended__ to set the reward address in the file `/etc/skywire.conf` by adding this line to the file:

```
REWARDSKYADDR=('')
```

Add your skycoin address there and run `skywire-autoconfig` on linux (assumes you have installed the package)

If this file does not exist for you, it can be created with `skywire cli config gen -q | tee /etc/skywire.conf`

**If you do this, please uncomment `PKGENV=true` before saving the file**

### Connection to DMSG network

For any given visor, the system hardware survey, transport setup-node survey, and transport bandwidth logs are collected **hourly** by the reward system over dmsg.

This can be verified by examining the visor's logging:

![image](https://github.com/skycoin/skywire/assets/36607567/eb66bca1-fc9e-4c80-a38a-e00a73f675d0)

The collected surveys and transport bandwidth log files should be visible in the survey index here:

[fiber.skywire.dev/log-collection/tree](https://fiber.skywire.dev/log-collection/tree)

An example of one such entry:
```
├─┬025e3e4e324a3ac2771e32b798ca3d8859e585ac36938b15a31d20982de6aa31fc

│ ├──node-info.json          "v1.3.21"
│ └──tp.json         Age: 6m56s []
```

Note: the transport bandwidth logging CSV files will only exist if it was generated; i.e. if there were transports to that visor which handled traffic.

Note: the system survey (node-info.json) will only exist if the reward address is set.

If your visor is not generating such logging or errors are indicated, please reach out to us on telegram [@skywire](https://t.me/skywire) for assistance

### Transportability

It is not required that a visor run any service, such as a vpn or socks5 proxy server, whichpermitsdirect access tothe internet from yor ip address. However, it is required that the visor is able to act as a hop along a route. A module is active at runtime which checks that transports may be established to that visor - the visor crates a dmsg transport to itself every few minutes to ensure transportability. If it's not possible to create a dmsg transport to the same visor after three attempts,the visor will shut down automatically. **It is expected that the visor will be restarted by a process control mechanism if the visor shuts down for any reason.** In the officially supported linux packages, systemd will restart the visor if it stops; regardless of the exit status of the process.

### Transport setup node

Previously, the transport setup node was run continuously as part of the reward system to ensure that visors were responding as expected to transport setup-node requests. However, there were intermittent issues with reliability of the results ; because there is no caching mechanism for responsiveness to transport setup-node requests as there exists for uptime.

Currently, the transport setup-nodes which are configured for the visor are included in the survey and verified as an eligibility requirement for rewards by the reward system.

### Ping Latency metric

Not yet implemented

### Transport bandwidth logs

The visor will only produce transport bandwidth logs in response to transports being established to them. These are collected, along with the system survey, and are displayed on the reward system [here](https://fiber.skywire.dev/log-collection/tplogs)

In the future, it is anticipated that the transport bandwidth logs and ping metric will be collected by the transport discovery automatically.

### Survey

On setting the skycoin reward address, the visor will generate and serve a sysytem survey over dmsg. Only keys which are whitelisted in the survey_whitelist array of the visor's config will have access to collect the survey.

To print the survey (approximately) as it would be served, one can use `skywire cli survey`

**The purpose of the survey is strictly for checking [eligibility requirements](#rules--requirements) numbers 3 through 7.**

### Verifying other requirements

If the visor is not able to meet the [eligibility requirements](#rules--requirements) numbers 8 through 13, that is usually not the fault of the user - nor is it something the user is expected to troubleshoot on their own at this time. Please ask for assistance on telegram [@skywire](https://t.me/skywire)

## Reward System overview

The skycoin reward address may be set for each visor using `skywire cli` or for all visors connected to a hypervisor from the hypervisor UI

The skycoin reward address is in a text file contained in the "local" folder (local_path in the skywire config file) i.e `local/reward.txt`.

The skycoin reward address is also included with the [system hardware survey](https://github.com/skycoin/skywire/tree/develop/cmd/skywire/README.md#survey) and served, along with transport logs, via dmsghttp.

The system survey (`local/node-info.json`) is fetched hourly by the reward system via `skywire cli log`; along with transport bandwidth logs.

A survey of transports which have been set by transport setup-nodes are also collected hourly, from all visors which have had surveys collected

The index of the collected files may be viewed at [fiber.skywire.dev/log-collection/tree](https://fiber.skywire.dev/log-collection/tree)

Once collected from the nodes, the surveys for those visors which met uptime are checked to verify hardware and other requirements, etc.

The system survey is only made available to those keys which are whitelisted for survey collection, but is additionally available to any `hypervisor` or `dmsgpty_whitelist` keys set in the config for a given visor.

**Setting a skycoin address is considered as consent for collecting the survey.**

The public keys which require to be whitelisted in order to collect the surveys, for the purpose of reward eligibility verification, should populate in the visor's config automatically when the config is generated.

## Reward System Funding & Distributions

The reward system is funded on a monthly basis. Sometimes there are unexpected or unavoidable delays in the funding. In these instances, rewards will be distributed based on the data generated wen the system is funded

## Deployment Outages

While we do our best to maintain the skywire production deployment, there have been instances of issues or outages in the past. We attempt to correct these outages as soon as possible and avoid recurrant disruptions.

The policy for handling rewards in the instance of a deployment outage is to repeat the distribution for the last day where uptime was unaffected by the outage; for the duration of the outage.

## Hardware

**Virtual Machines, servers, and personal computers are currently not eligible to collect rewards**

_NOTE: this list of hardware was used with the initial implementation of the reward system - which required an application with pictures to be submitted. This no longer applies. The new reward system does not differentiate hardware except by architecture - only x86_64 / amd64 hardware is excluded from rewards currently. Every visor will receive the same reward amount, regardless of the hardware specs. It should be noted that the main difference between using cheap or low-end hardware and high-end hardware is the ease of maintenance and speed of updates for the node operator._
